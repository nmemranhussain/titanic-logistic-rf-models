**Training Data:** Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle (Link to dataset if possible).  
**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall.

## Responsible AI
This model was built using packages that promote responsible AI practices, such as:
- **[PiML](https://github.com/yexf308/pyinter)** for interpretable machine learning.
- **[InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret)** for explaining and visualizing model predictions.

**Fairness Considerations:** Biases in the training data, particularly related to gender and class, have been considered. Interpretability tools were used to understand the modelâ€™s behavior and its impact on protected groups.

## Training Data
**Dataset Name:** Titanic Training Data  
**Number of Samples:** 891  
**Features Used:** Passenger class, gender, age, fare, etc.  
**Data Source:** (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)

## Test Data

### Source of Test Data
The Titanic test dataset used in this model is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=test.csv).
[Link to Jupyter Notebook](http://localhost:8889/notebooks/Titanic_logistic.ipynb?)

### Number of Rows in Test Data
- **Number of rows in Test Data:** 418

### Differences Between Training and Test Data
- The test dataset does not include the `Survived` column, which is the target variable in the training dataset.
- All other feature columns are the same between the training and test datasets.

## Model Details

### Columns Used as Inputs in the Final Model
The following columns were used as inputs (features) in the final model:
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Fare
- Embarked

### Column(s) Used as Target(s) in the Final Model
- **Target Column:** Survived

### Type of Model
The model used is a **Logistic Regression** classifier.

### Software Used to Implement the Model
- **Software:** Python (with libraries such as Scikit-learn)
- **Version of the Modeling Software:** scikit-learn 1.x

### Hyperparameters or Other Settings of the Model
The following hyperparameters were used for the Logistic Regression model:
- **Solver:** lbfgs
- **Maximum Iterations:** 100
- **Regularization (C):** 1.0
- Features used in the model: ['Pclass', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', 'Sex_male', 'Embarked_Q', 'Embarked_S']

## Quantitative Analysis

### Metrics Used to Evaluate the Final Model
The following metrics were used to evaluate the final model:
- **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
- **AIR (Adverse Impact Ratio)**: A fairness metric that compares outcomes between groups, such as male vs. female survival rates.

### Final Values of Metrics for All Data:

| Dataset     | AUC   | AIR  |
|-------------|-------|------|
| Training    | 0.85  | 0.83 |
| Validation  | 0.81  | 0.77 |
| Test        | 0.85  | 0.83 |
