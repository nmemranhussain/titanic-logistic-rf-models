## Basic Information
**Names:** N M Emran Hussain  
**Email:** nmemran.hussain@gwu.edu  
**Date:** October 2024  
**Model Version:** 1.0.0  
**License:** [MIT License](LICENSE)

**Repository:** [https://github.com/nmemranhussain/titanic-ml-models]

## Model Implementation
Logistic Regression : http://localhost:8889/notebooks/Titanic_logistic.ipynb?
Random Forest : http://localhost:8889/notebooks/Titanic_RF.ipynb?

## Intended Use
**Purpose:** The model predicts survival on the Titanic dataset using various machine learning algorithms.  
**Intended Users:** Data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, educators.  
**Out-of-scope Uses:** The model is not intended for production use in any critical applications or real-time decision-making systems.

## Model Details
**Architecture:** This model utilizes linear models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc., for classification tasks.  
**Training Data:** Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle (Link to dataset if possible).  
**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall.

## Responsible AI
This model was built using packages that promote responsible AI practices, such as:
- **[PiML](https://github.com/yexf308/pyinter)** for interpretable machine learning.
- **[InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret)** for explaining and visualizing model predictions.

**Fairness Considerations:** Biases in the training data, particularly related to gender and class, have been considered. Interpretability tools were used to understand the modelâ€™s behavior and its impact on protected groups.

## Training Data
**Dataset Name:** Titanic Training Data  
**Number of Samples:** 891  
**Features Used:** Passenger class, gender, age, fare, etc.  
**Data Source:** (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)

## Test Data

### Source of Test Data
The Titanic test dataset used in this model is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=test.csv).
[Link to Jupyter Notebook](http://localhost:8889/notebooks/Titanic_logistic.ipynb?)


### Number of Rows in Test Data
- **Number of rows in Test Data:** 418

### Differences Between Training and Test Data
- The test dataset does not include the `Survived` column, which is the target variable in the training dataset.
- All other feature columns are the same between the training and test datasets.
